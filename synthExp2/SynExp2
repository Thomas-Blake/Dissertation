In this experiment we have one large normal distribution surrounded by many smaller normal distributions
balancedBoundary - dictionary object containing the points on the boundary of the Bayes Estimator for the class balanced loss function
normalBoundary - dictionary object containing the points on the boundary of the Bayes Estimator for the usual softmax corss entropy loss
