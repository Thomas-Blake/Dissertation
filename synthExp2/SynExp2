In this experiment we have one large normal distribution surrounded by many smaller normal distributions
balancedBoundary - dictionary object containing the points on the boundary of the Bayes Estimator for the class balanced loss function
normalBoundary - dictionary object containing the points on the boundary of the Bayes Estimator for the usual softmax corss entropy loss

We look to compare the different methods as in the Menon paper
We consider 10,000 data points for train and 10,000 for test
  We repeat for 100 independent samples
