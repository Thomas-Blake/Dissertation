In this experiment I plan to introduce more classes. Ensure everyone has a different frequency.
mu =0.8

NeuralNetTraining1
Train a normal Neural network using a balanced and non-balanced loss

NueralNetTraining2
Decouple classifier and feature representation as in Kang paper

NeuralNetTraining3
Looks at standard ERM and investigates over training on classes
Want to show overfitting
Split classes into groups
1,2,3 in one group, then 4,5,6,7,8 etc to give 7 groups
