In this experiment I plan to introduce more classes. Ensure everyone has a different frequency.
mu =0.8

NeuralNetTraining1
Train a normal Neural network using a balanced and non-balanced loss

NueralNetTraining2
Decouple classifier and feature representation as in Kang paper

NeuralNetTraining3
Looks at standard ERM and investigates over training on classes
